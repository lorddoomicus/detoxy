DETOXY v0.1
==================================================================
detoxy is a simple and portable detokenizer for Commodore BASIC programs.  

It currently supports the extensions .bas for the following systems:

- BASIC 2.0 on the Vic20 
- BASIC 2.0 on C64 
- BASIC 3.5 on TED based systems 

It also supports .p00 from VICE.  Other BASIC versions and formats will be likely implemented in the future.

EXAMPLE USAGE
==================================================================
For processing a standard C64 BASIC file, just type:

        detoxy myfile.bas

If you saved the BASIC file from inside an emulator, for example VICE, the file extension might be "p00".  In this case, the file has an extended header which begins with "C64File", and it can be skipped by issuing the following parameter:

        detoxy -f p00 myfile.p00

The parameter "-f bas" is currently redundant, but is provided for future use.

To display information about the detected BASIC version at the beginning of the output:

	detoxy -b myfile.bas

TEST FILES
==================================================================
The directory "tests" provides a few sample files for testing detoxy.
