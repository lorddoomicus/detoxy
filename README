DETOXY v0.1
==================================================================
detoxy is a simple and portable detokenizer for Commodore BASIC programs.  
It supports the extensions .bas (BASIC 2.0 and BASIC 3.5) and 
.p00 (C64 emulator, VICE) - other BASIC versions will be implemented 
in the future.

EXAMPLE USAGE
==================================================================
For processing a standard C64 BASIC file, just type:

        detoxy myfile.bas

If you saved the BASIC file from inside an emulator, for example VICE,
the file extension might be "p00".  In this case, the file has an extended
header which begins with "C64File", and it can be skipped by issuing the
following parameter:

        detoxy -f p00 myfile.p00

The parameter "-f bas" is currently redundant, but is provided for
future use.

To display the detected BASIC version at the beginning of the output:

	detoxy -p myfile.bas

TEST FILES
==================================================================
The directory "tests" provides a few sample files for testing detoxy.
